# Thank you for your contribution!

We have a number of requirements for contributions and this template helps to make sure that these requirements are known.

The text between the following horizontal lines will go into the merge commit message: this will help people who look at the history later to understand what happens.
Everything outside of them is for the communication during the pull request review process only.
