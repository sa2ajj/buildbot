Buildbot Cookbook
=================

   The term cookbook is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to any book containing a straightforward set of already tried and tested "recipes" or instructions for a specific field or activity, presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results

Buildbot cookbook consists of recipes that focus on one specific thing -- either a particular version control system, or a particular feature of Buildbot -- and show its various aspects, while offerring an almost ready to use snippet of Buildbot configuration.

The level of these recipes is a bit higher than the one of :doc:`tutorials <../tutorial/index>`, however they should be easily followed together with the reference documentation that is cross-references from the accompanying description.
